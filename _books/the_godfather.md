One of my favorite books. My favorite chapter was the prosecutions speech against Dmitri. He made a rock solid argument about why dmitri is guilty. He attacked dmitiri psychologicaly, saying is htis man who is such a slave to vice really to have the self control to hold half of katerinas money. He also made arguments in support of snerdigayov, reasoned why he beat gregory, and with the main matter of the letter on the floor with money taken out he obviously pins this against dmitiri.
